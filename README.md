## project pandemonium

# description
CLI card RPG written in C for algorithm practice. Mainly inspired by SMT's Devil Survivor
series for the 3DS and Slay the Spire. 

# to do 
- implement GUI and rewrite code using another language (preferably C++ but java is okay ig...)

# main menu 

# preparation
- cards depend 

# gameplay 
- includes 2 phases: movement and combat. 
- cards 

# other things 
- random map generation using jagged arrays (w/ minimum size set
to prevent degenerate case of 1x1 maps)
- shortest path algorithm for enemies to identify and move where player is. 
- binary I/O for saving data
